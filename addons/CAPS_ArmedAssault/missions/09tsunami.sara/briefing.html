Following the success of the great battle we have the remaining enemy forces completely surrounded at their capital city Bagango, despite their humiliating losses they are still refusing to surrender. The last remnants of the SLA’s military might continue to hold their positions as they wait for our next imminent move. Following a hasty flyover by one of our Harrier jets we were able to ascertain the basic layout of the enemy’s positions, these consist of one main pocket of enemy troops and a number of smaller camps of troops spread all over the city. More importantly the co-pilot of the Harrier noticed what he believes to be a civilian prison camp, so before we can launch our main assault we must investigate this camp and find out whether their are civilians being held against their will. If it’s discovered that it is indeed some kind of civilian prison you should liberate the inhabitants by killing any enemies guarding the camp. Only then can you proceed with the primary objective of attacking the remaining enemy forces within the city of Bagango.
