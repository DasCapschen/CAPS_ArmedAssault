Dearest Mom and Dad,
<br><br>
Sorry it's been so long since I last wrote. I haven't had a moment to write even the briefest of notes.
<br>
I know you'll be worried about me, but so far we've been very lucky. Hope it stays that way.
<br><br>
I don't know if this letter will get through to you, but I'm writing it anyway, just in case. I just want you all to know that I'm thinking of you, and can't wait to get back home.
<BR><BR>
Your loving son, 
<br>
David

As we now have a greater military strength in part due to the US reinforcements who finally arrived, we are pushing the SLAs back into the Northern island. By order of headquarters we should show our enemies no mercy. Our forces are trying to reclaim the city of Corazol as well as the surrounding bases built by the enemy. Our large attack is going to clean out one of those bases, this one is filled with SLA heavy armoured units. Your task is to board the chopper, fly in there and support our operation from the air. Once all of the enemy tanks are destroyed, fly back to the airport, we will send in further troops to finish cleaning up the SLA mess.<br><br>HINT: You will have one more chopper at your command as well.

<p>The enemy base was not attacked. All of the enemy armored vehicles are intact and will most certainly be used against us in the future. God help us all.</p>
