Enemy is preparing to attack us here in the city of Dolores. SLA forces have built a lot of camps around the city to keep us passive. We lost some soldiers yesterday when they were moving North of Dolores, so we sent two scouts to check the position of those camps. And here we go, three enemy camps have been found and located. Our wait is over, go there and kill all the enemy soldiers hiding in those camps. You will have 2 HMMVW at your command, one with M2 machine gun, one with MK 19 grenade launcher. Make sure you don't lose both vehicles, at least one of them has to be delivered back in Dolores. We have an heavy insufficiency of mobile units now. <BR><BR> Note: Try to find and destroy another enemy camp, which should be hidden somewhere in the North and which our scouts didn't discover. That should let us breathe for a while.<BR><BR> Hint:  Ones you are out of ammo, try to go to our lost <a href="marker:ammo">ammunition dump</a> North from Dolores. You will find its position in the map, but we are not sure if the enemy hasn't discovered and stole it already.

Enemy is preparing to attack us here in the city of Dolores. Lots of small SLA camps are surrounding us now. Because of that, we have lost some soldiers over there. Our scouts reported us the positions of three of those enemy camps, but as we suspect, there are more of them. Your main task is to command two HMMWV's, infiltrate all 3 known camps and kill everything that is moving. You can try to search for some hidden camps and destroy them as well. That should clear our breathing condition a bit more. At least one HMMWV has to be delivered back in Dolores - keep it in mind.
