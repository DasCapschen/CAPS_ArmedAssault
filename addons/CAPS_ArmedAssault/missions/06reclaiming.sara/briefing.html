The Marines have landed North of Paraiso, and quickly managed to roll through the weakened Slag lines in the South. The Northern coastal front however is still too well defended to attempt a direct assault.
<br><br>
Despite all their fancy heavy armor, the Marines still need our help in opening up the road to Corazol. There is one small desert road leading behind the main enemy positions. It's well guarded, but just outside of the SLA air defense canopy.
<br><br>
Marine AV-8Bs will take out the Slags' defensive position, and our Strykers will race through the gap before the enemy even realizes their flank is exposed. We pop their Shilkas, and with the help of some gunships take control the main bridge behind their Northern front. With their air defenses out of action, gunships and Abrams tanks will be pouring in from all sides.
