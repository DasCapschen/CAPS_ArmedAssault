You'll have to place the explosives close to the targets. Most of the soldiers on the base will be sleeping; however there will be <a href="marker:guards">some patrols</a> around the base that should be avoided if possible. If you’re detected and the guards sound the alarm, the base will quickly be filled with soldiers and you will in all likelihood die, rapidly.</a>.

The enemy has mostly regrouped around the capital city of Ortego and it’s obvious that we'll soon meet their first reinforced defensive lines. Our scouts who landed on the Western coast yesterday have discovered a small <a href="marker:ebase">enemy base</a> well hidden in the Northern woods. There are some <a href="marker:tanks">tanks</a> at this base and it's those that have us concerned. The enemy knows that we are close to them and they will surely want to use these armor reinforcements to outflank us and then attack from behind in the midst of battle and grind us into dust. We are going to use one of our saboteurs to destroy the armored vehicles stationed there.
