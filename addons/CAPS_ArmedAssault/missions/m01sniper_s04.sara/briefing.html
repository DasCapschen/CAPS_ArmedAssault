Make sure you aren't detected, that will abort the mission, because the enemy officer and his guards will be instantly alerted by radio.

We have intercepted some news over the radio. One of the SLAs best officers will be transported to the <a href="marker:hotel">Vida hotel</a> near the town of Vallejo, where he will prepare the tactics for their next attack against us. Your task will be to sneak through the <a href="marker:camps">guarding</a> <a href="marker:camps_1">camps</a> around the hotel and hide yourself in a <a href="marker:place">position</a> where you will be able to observe the hotel. Once the officer arrives, let him go into the hotel. If you shoot him before he has entered the hotel, you will probably have no chance to reach your extraction point alive. The officers' hotel room is located on the North facing side of the building, so get yourself into the best shooting position and once he is visible through the window or perhaps steps out onto the balcony, shoot that SLA scum down and run to the extraction point. Be precise in your actions, if you succeed the shit is going to hit the fan immediately.
