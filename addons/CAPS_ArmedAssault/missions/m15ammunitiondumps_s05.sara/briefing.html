<p><a name="plan"></a>
We're still waiting for US reinforcements, they're on their way but the latest news we've received is that they will arrive tomorrow at the earliest. In the meantime SLAs forces are pushing us really badly and right now we're preparing for a big attack on our airport. We have stored most of our ammunition supplies in the area of the old factory in the capital city of Paraiso. Although this information has been kept secret, we have to consider the fact that the enemy probably know about that and will send saboteurs to destroy it. There are three ammunition dumps to guard. Your task is to patrol here and guard our ammo supplies throughout the night until two US trucks arrive here to pick it up and deliver it to our base at the airport in the morning.
