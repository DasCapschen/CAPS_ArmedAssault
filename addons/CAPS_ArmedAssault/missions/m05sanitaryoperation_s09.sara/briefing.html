The SLA forces are really close to our capital city of Paraiso now. They have seized the town of Corinto and cold bloodedly killed a number of civilians who refused to leave their houses. The enemy knows that we don't have a lot of men, so they'll be expecting something, but not a counter-attack. And that's how we will surprise them. You are a member of the special saboteur squad Foxtrot, which will attack Corinto from the North. The second team called Bravo is preparing on the west side of the town and will attack it from that side. 
<br><br>
Foxtrot and Bravo will meet right in the city. Make sure that you kill every enemy soldier in the town and when they try to flee, don't let them. We want to show them that we are not afraid and we are ready to fight. Kill all those SLA bastards, seize the city and make your way back to the HMMWV which will be waiting near the insertion point for you. You will return to the Paraiso. Do it quickly, it's likely that some enemy reinforcements will arrive.
<br><br>
You'll start <a href="marker:start">northly of Corinto.</a>. Bravo Squad will attack the town<a href="marker:N1">from the east.</a>
