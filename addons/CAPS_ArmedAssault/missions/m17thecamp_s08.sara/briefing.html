Remember, it's possible to lose some of the engineers and still build the camp, but the less workers you have, the slower the building process will be. You can use team switch to play as everyone from the protect team.

We've decided to try to surround the enemy, so we're sending in a special team to build a <a href="marker:camp">camp</a> close to <a href="marker:eter">enemy territory</a>. There are 3 main engineers in this team, they are specialized in building basic structures. Let's call them the cornerstone of this operation, because once they are killed, it will be impossible to finish building this camp. Another two special engineers in the team are able to build defensive structures which can help with trying to hold this place against <a href="marker:attack">enemy attacks</a>. The team is completed by four soldiers who will be there to protect the engineers against possible enemy attack. You are the leader of this protect group, don't allow the main workers to be killed. Once the camp is ready we'll send a chopper with reinforcements. Hold the place until the chopper has arrived. If we are lucky, there will be no attack at all. Let's hope that nobody will see you land there. Briefing is over. Get to the <a href="marker:boat">boat</a>, now!
