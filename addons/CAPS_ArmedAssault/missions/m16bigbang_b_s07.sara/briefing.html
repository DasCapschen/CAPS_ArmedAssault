Don't forget that you will be going deep into their own backyard, so be sure to be on your guard as you make your to the convoy as there may be some enemy soldiers along the way. Don't waste your time with them unless absolutely necessary, try to keep going. You have to be really fast, the closer the convoy will be to Bogango, the sooner that reinforcements may come to their aid. It's more than possible that after you destroy the convoy, you will be the one who is hunted, so be on your guard.<BR><BR>Team switch will be available.

Our special team caused huge damage in one of the SLA's bases at the city of Obregan. It seems that they're really scared now and they want to do all that they can to ensure they don't lose any more men in <a href="marker:ebase">this complex</a>, so they're trying to escape and <a href="marker:camp">regroup</a> in their capital city Bagango. The whole convoy includes two trucks filled with soldiers. They are moving through their territory, so they won't be expecting any US attack on <a href="marker:way">their way</a>. We will try to take our chances, so we'll send <a href="marker:start">two HMMWV's</a> (one with machine gun and one with grenade launcher) to hunt that fleeing convoy, <a href="marker:destroy">destroy it</a> and quickly drive back <a href="marker:end">to Corazol</a> before SLA's reinforcements arrive.

Great job, soldier! You hunted them down like the vermin they are.

The SLA's convoy is now safe and the enemy has regrouped in Bagango.

Both HMMWVs were destroyed. You failed.

You allowed only one of the HMMWVs to be destroyed, not bad, but not great either.
