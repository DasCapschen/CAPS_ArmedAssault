The news of a reinforced Marine Expeditionary Unit approaching the island has spread like wildfire. Last night, I saw the first happy faces in my squad since the SLA tanks rolled into Corazol. But waking up this morning and seeing the thunderclouds overhead just feels like a sick twist of fate.
<br><br>
I guess we'll have to do without air support for just a little while longer. None of the guys here is willing to admit it, but we're desperate for the Marines to give us a hand. The whole Company is effectively down to one single Platoon, putting me as squad leader in charge of a quarter of that force...

SLA forces have landed behind the main RACS defensive line along the Northern coast. While a USMC fleet is approaching the island, they can't launch any air support sorties yet due to the bad weather. Our plan is to hold off the SLA forces until the weather clears up enough for the USMC attack aircraft to provide support.
