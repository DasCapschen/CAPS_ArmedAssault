The heartland of South Sahrani is still firmly in our hands and the RACS are doing a great job defending the Northern part of the country. However, the enemy now controls most of the Southern provinces. While we're expecting some Slag attacks tonight, our Night Vision capabilities should give us a major advantage. This could be our first shot at launching a counter attack on the enemy's positions and hitting them where it hurts.

As expected, the SLA forces are trying to push Northwards during the night. Other than the tanks, most of their troops are not equipped with Night Vision equipment, making any large formation movements at night a great target of opportunity for us.
