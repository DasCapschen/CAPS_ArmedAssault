STRC_01v01,"\n\nName’s William Porter, PFC, US Army. My company \ngot shipped out here to the “island paradise” of Sahrani\nabout six months back."
STRC_01v02,"\n\nSeemed like a real boondoggle at first. Lie on the beach\non an island in the bumfuck middle of the Atlantic with not\nmuch more to do than spend our beer vouchers."
STRC_01v03,"\n\nBetween hangovers, we tried to teach the grunts of the Kingdom of South Sahrani the finer points of soldiering,\nmuch good as that did."
STRC_01v04,"\n\nWhy they need us here in this sweat-soaked hole,\nI don’t know."
STRC_01v05,"\nThe commies in the Northern “Democratic” Republic of Sahrani on the other side of the island used to have a hard-on for the royal family, but it’s been seven years since anyone’s so much as fired a bullet over the border."
STRC_01v06,"\n\nTheory is that training the Royals to defend their country will lend stability to the region, but they mostly just want to know how to march pretty in parades."
STRC_01v07,"\n\nDon’t understand it myself, but it beats being used\nfor target practice in the Big Sandbox, I guess."
STRC_01v08,"\n\nMost of us have already bugged out, but my company drew\nthe short straw and got stuck with the wrap-up."
STRC_01v09,"\nSahrani is as beautiful a place as you’d ever want to see —\nnice people, sunny beaches, majestic mountains, lush forest —\nbut there’s little a finely tuned soldier can\ndo here but rust."
STRC_01v10,"\n\nCan’t say I’d be sad to see this place get sucked into\nthe sea behind us when we leave."
