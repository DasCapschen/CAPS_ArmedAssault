Do not immediately attempt the main objective of the mission, the first step should be to do a little scouting around. There will be a radio somewhere in the camp which the SLA will try to use to call for reinforcements when you are detected. By whatever means at your disposal you must not allow the radio to be used. Remember as well that you cannot let them flee because they will most likely try to run for reinforcements. <BR><BR> Don't forget what your main target is, guard the entrance to the garage, so that nobody can go in and drive the Urals away. Once you have cleared the base send in the saboteur unit to place satchel charges on the Urals.

There are two large SLA bases in the city of Obregan. At the Northern one there should be two Urals completely filled with ammunition. If we can <a href="marker:destroy">destroy</a> them we'll deal a significant blow to the enemy. To accomplish the objective we've put together a <a href="marker:start">special team</a> consisting of our two best snipers and one saboteur, you are the leader of this group. You have to be swift and clinical in your actions, we cannot allow one single SLA unit to use the <a href="marker:radio">radio</a> to inform the second base of your attack and ask for reinforcements. Once you have completed the mission head to the <a href="marker:end">extraction point</a> where you will be collected by chopper. By no means is this going to be an easy mission, but that's war, it's not meant to be easy.

You allowed the enemy to gather reinforcements and they saved their urals. You failed, miserably.
