The green light for the invasion couldn't have come at a better time. The guys from 3rd Squad had a run-in with some Royals over in Corazol just a few days ago. We've noticed many Southerners seem to hold us responsible for what happened at Cayo and Tiberia, but so far it hasn’t come to any real confrontations. I guess our politicians holding off the invasion for so long didn't contribute much to the atmosphere here. The Royals are absolutely dead set on taking out the Northern regime, and I can't blame them after what the SLA just did.
<br><br>
We have two operations ahead of us. A base has been established in the city of Modesta, and we expect the SLA to launch a counter attack there soon. Additionally, we're proceeding to push Eastward, to ensure no SLA troops will be able to reinforce any counterattacks or disrupt our supply lines.</a>
