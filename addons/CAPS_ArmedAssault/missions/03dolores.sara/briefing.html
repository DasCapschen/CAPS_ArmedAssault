A large-scale ambush is being prepared for the SLA armored force moving South from <a href="marker:Ortego">Ortego</a>. The bridges in the city of <a href="marker:Dolores">Dolores</a> connect all major roads in the South of the island. Taking them out is an obvious priority, but we plan on taking out a large amount of SLA armor along with them.
</p>
<p>
The city's center is located between two arms of the sea reaching inland, resulting in a peninsula-like landmass. Taking out the city's three bridges will leave any units trapped in the center with only one escape: North. At the base of the peninsula, 3rd Platoon has prepared a defensive line that will engage the enemy forces attempting to get out of the city. The remnants of 2nd Platoon will try to hold off any enemy reinforcements coming in from the East.

<p>
To further 'motivate' the enemy to move out of the center, we have placed hidden caches of M136 Anti-Tank rounds around the town for you to use.

<p>
Despite the eventual retreat, a large part of the SLA armored force was succesfully destroyed at Dolores. This has surely reduced the strength of future enemy operations in the Southern sector, giving us time to reestablish our defenses.

The enemy forces were prematurely alerted to the ambush, and managed to pull out in time.
