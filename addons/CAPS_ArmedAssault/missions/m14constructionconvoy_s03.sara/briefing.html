Our ally father Vassal has been informed about the situation so his servants have taken the <a href="marker:ammo">US ammunition</a> that was hidden in the basements andhave hidden it somewhere around the church. The exact location is unfortunately unknown. Be sure that your actions will be quick and decisive, because once the enemy forces in Ortego hear the first detonation, they will certainly send <a href="marker:reinforcements">reinforcements</a> to your location to find out what's going on.

The SLA want to reinforce their position to the North of Dolores, to do this they intend to build a large new camp near the city of Gelardo as a holding place for more of their troops. They're sending a convoy of Ural trucks filled with supplies to build the camp. We intercepted this information by radio and we're pretty sure that it's not a trap. We will deliver you there by boat, be sure it doesn't get damaged, because it is the last one that we have. We are sending one of our best scouts over there, after your landing he'll immediately take up a <a href="marker:scout">position</a> near to the road that the convoy will travel along, he will report to you when the convoy is close to the city. Then he will return to the boat and wait for you in the driver's position where he will be ready for a speedy departure once you complete your objective and return to his location.</p>
